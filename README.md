# peAk-dev-schematic

peAk: App for snowboarders and skiers who want to consolidate their trip planning and intragroup communcation to one place.

The project itself is a remake and extension of the [peAk browser applicaiton](https://github.com/apex-trio/peAk).

THIS version of the concept was written as a [Android App](https://github.com/twelve-sixty/peAk) with a [Django Back-end](https://github.com/twelve-sixty/peAk-backend).

This schematic series represents the collective agreed upon applicatiton structure in development. I made it in Adobe Illustrator, and we used as a social and technical refrence for the duration of the project.

The red here indicates pieces of the app which aren't complete. The ghosted sections represent ones that were cut due to time constraints. All other features have been completed ahead of schedule. I'm confident that if the weather had allowed us the time this would be in the play store, but I'm proud of how far we got in what was essentially 3 days and another one or two would result in a full scale app in the play store.
